# Portfolio
This repository contains samples of various scripts, reports, and documents I have created over the past six and a half years of research, bioinformatics, and my time as a graduate student. Contained within are four different documents I would like to highlight. 

1) The document titled "DNAzol_Extraction_Protocol_Optimized_For_Swab_Sampling_With_Sodium_Acetate_Purification.pdf". This document is a protocol that I adapted and optimized for the extraction of microbial DNA from a cloacal swab taken from a broiler chicken. While this was created in 2019 and I have since updated my approach to creating protocols, I believe that this is a good example of a laboratory standard operating procedure I am able to create. 

2) The file titled "Portolio_Script.sh" is my most recent bash scripts used in the structural variant and SNP pipelines used in analyzing whole genome DNA sequencing information. I have had to redact or change some file names as well as remove portions of the code to protect my IP as this is an ongoing research project for my dissertation, but am willing to verbally discuss the details and goals of this pipeline. 

3) The file titled "TAMU_Certificate_In_Applied_Statistics.pdf". This file is a multi-page report I submitted in partiall fulfillment of my certificate in applied statistics from the department of statistics at Texas A&M University. I created this in 2020 using Rmarkdown and generated the data and figures contained using R with assorted R packages. I believe that this file shows a moderate comprehension of R as well as my ability to create formal reports. 

4) The document titled "ULT_Freezer_Maintenance_SOP_CY2020.pdf" is an example of an SOP I wrote as designated laboratory manager. The goal of this document was to standardize the maintenance of a critical piece of laboratory equipment, serve as a year-on-year record of maintenance, and to be a training document for new students taking on the maintenance and inspection tasks. 

Thank you for your interest and I hope that these documents can provide some insight into my work ethic, reasoning, attention to detail, and skill set.
